# REmindey
Reminders app to help you never forget a thing.

Technologies used: Android Studio, Java, and Firebase for the backend.

The app features creats daily reminders and alerts, with an option to create reminders that are triggered on the user's home location (using Geofence and location services), reminders such as "Did you lock the door?" when you left your home and same reminder when you return, also to feed your pet or check laundry (the user can easily enable these reminders in the settings). 

Also, there are reminders templates for frequent reminders that the user can easily create, e.g., pill reminders- the user can choose how many times a day to take a pill and the time, and if they want a food reminder before/after taking his medicines.

If the user sets a reminder to high priority, he can receive a second reminder 10 minutes after clicking on it, to make sure he did it.
REmindey should help people who tend to forget some basic things they do in their daily lives and are insecure about it, never forget a thing.
