# REmindey
Reminders app to help you not forget a thing.

Technologies used: Android Sutdio, Java, Firebase for backend.

The app features creating daily reminders and alerts, with an option to create reminders that are triggered on the user's home location (using Geofence and location services), reminders such as "Did you lock the door?" when you left your home or same reminder when you arrived home, also to feed your pet or check laundry (the user can easily enable these reminders in the settings). 

Also, there are reminders templates for frequent reminders that the user can easily create, e.g. pill reminders- the user can choose how many times a day to take a pill and the time, and also if they want a food reminder before/after taking his medicines.

If the user set a reminder to high priority, he can receive a second reminder 10 minutes after he clicked done on it, just to make sure he did it.
REmindey should help people who tend to forget and some basic things they do in their daily life and being insecure about it, not to forget a thing.
